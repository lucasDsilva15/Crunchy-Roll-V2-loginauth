# Name

Crunchy-Spin v2 

## Description

Crunchy-Spin v2 Is a new and imporved version of a previous project on my github named Crunchy-Spin, which was a mock store of popular anime site CrunchyRoll:
 https://store.crunchyroll.com 
This store was created to simulate everything I have learned from the MERN stack from PerScholas. With two working CRUD models and User Authentication with encrypted passwords. The Site includes a wishlist for users that have a login, where they can save information on products they are interested in purhcasing as well as linking directly to the product they are interested in.

## Usage

When using the site on the register page there will be a developer option, this is purely to demonstrate the second CRUD model where a user with Dev priviliges will be able to add, edit, and delete products on the site itself, Simply register with any random credentials you would like or you can use the dev login 
username: hello password: world


## Deploy 
This site was deployed using netflify and cyclic, the link to open the site is here:
https://main--thriving-arithmetic-7e4ffb.netlify.app


## Future updates
I am quite proud with the state of this current project, However one critical change I would like to make is adding a footer to the site to add a bit more realism to the store.
Also Making the site mobile friendly would be a large improvement and will probably happen in the near future.
